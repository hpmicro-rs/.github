## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the home of hpmicro-rs, an unofficial team of embedded hobbyists dedicated to adding Rust support for HPMicro's RISC-V microcontrollers.

Please note that all projects are in their early stages and are not recommended for use in final products. 
These projects are better suited for personal experimentation and exploration.
